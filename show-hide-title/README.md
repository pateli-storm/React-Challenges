# Show-Hide/itle


In this React challenge, you'll create a dynamic component that allows you to toggle the visibility of a title. By clicking a button labeled "Show / Hide," you'll be able to control whether the title "Welcome to React Challenges" is displayed or hidden.



## Learning Objectives:

 - **useState Hook:** Gain hands-on experience with the `useState` hook, a fundamental React tool for managing component state.     You'll understand how to use it to store and update the visibility state of the title.  
 - **Conditional Rendering:** Explore the power of conditional rendering in React, achieved using the logical AND operator (`&&`) within JSX. The title will only be rendered if the `show` state is `true`.
 - **Event Handling:** Practice handling user interactions using the `onClick` event handler on the button. This handler triggers the `handleClick` function when the button is clicked
